I don't think I can find anyone here<br>
Cuz all I see are phantoms of caricatures<br>
Have you seen that movie that just came out<br>
Coulda sworn I saw you in it<br>

Is it strange? Is it strange?<br>
The second person is just a twist on the first<br>
And the third would make me God<br>

Is it strange? Is it strange?<br>
To think of you, as my personal art piece I know, its kinda self-centered<br>
But hear me out, I think we're lonelier than we like to think<br>

This fabric isnâ€™t hard<br>
It's any color its every shape<br>
That makes your head feel fine<br>
This can be quite comforting or plain petrifying<br>

	style ="color: white; text-align: center;margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">

Drive you mad, or blind the man<br>
Power designed to mold to your mind<br>
So if you're wanting, if you're looking<br>
I guess here might be the place and time<br>
</p>

<p

	style ="color: white; text-align: center;margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">

To realize this paradise<br>
Take this cloth and squeeze its truths out of it<br>
I doubt it'll disappoint,<br>
Cuz the fluid that'll ooze out can be every shade of<br> 

</p>
<p

	style ="color: white; text-align: center;margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">

Bleak and happy<br>
Enlightening and endarkening<br>
And what's likely is you'll never be the same<br>
After having run these liquids through your hands<br>
