If we can say that, all things come to an end<br>
Then we can conclude that, all dreams come to an end<br>
And the difference we like to see between us and them<br> 
Is that we chose to wake up, and therefore inhabit a world apart from theirs<br>
But If we can understand distance as just an abstraction to describe a position in space<br>
And realize the relativity of the claim for distance, we can also conclude<br>
We, in one sense, never left the first world<br>
And therefore woke up to the same world we were in pervious to awakening<br>
So how, if at all possible, do we truly wake and truly escape?<br>
