			Don't You Ever Wonder Why It's Always Raining, Or Did You Not Notice, You're Drenched

Yesterday I saw a boy with a skeleton mask<br>
Walking with a broken bat drenched in blood<br>
Atop the establishments surrounding us<br>
The billboards scream for attention<br>


</p>

<p

	style ="color: white; text-align: center;margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">


Yeah one night I was wandering through the low-lit streets<br>
To find a warehouse packed with bodies<br>
And I screamed and I screamed that they should leave<br>
But not one listened I didn’t understand<br>

</p>

<p

	style ="color: white; text-align: center;margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">

Until I choked on the fumes<br>
That congested the room<br>


</p>

<p

	style ="color: white; text-align: center;margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">

Apparitions so deluded and paralyzed on prescription<br>
With optophobic side-effects, is this the way we should be living<br>
Everyday it feels like the world could end<br>
And the rain won't stop drenching us<br>
And all I know is that we can’t afford<br>
To waste our time anymore<br>


</p>

	style ="color: white; text-align: center;margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">

A City Upon a Hill, what a wonderful city we are<br>
We have sedation, mind-control, and the likes of every hallucinogen<br>
And intoxicant, in the most seductive of forms<br>
Come one, come all<br>
To this city upon<br> 
A hill, a glimmering example of<br> 
The most complex systems<br> 
Of roboticism<br>
The world has to offer, A City Upon a Hill<br>

The zeppelin surveils the night sky<br>
And broadcasts chemicals through capillary waves<br>
But the velvet underground chants beneath<br>
The street while the rain seeps through the cable chambers<br>


</p>
<p

	style ="color: white; text-align: center;margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">

And attempts to sabotage what hope they’ve got<br>
</p>
